  <p>Welcome to UniStays! This website was created by MMU students for MMU students.</p>
  <p>Using our accomodation finder tool, you are able to find, connect and meet your new roommates so that when moving day
  comes around, you aren't left wondering who you're living with!</p>
  <p>Additionally, UniStays lets you review and comment on accomodations you've lived in, in order to help other students make
  the perfect decision for their next academic year</p>
  <p>We hope you enjoy using our website and please let us know if you want any improvements. Thank you!</p>
